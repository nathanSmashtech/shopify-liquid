If you file a chargeback with your payment processor, Skinny Fit will be unable to apply a credit or refund to you. Should your bank or credit card issuer reverse a charge to your credit card, we may bill you directly and seek payment by another method including a mailed statement. If you feel that your credit/debit card was used fraudulently on www.skinnyfit.com, please contact us for immediate resolution.</p>
                <p>15. Your Results Will Vary</p>

                <p>a. General</p>
                <p>Arbitration is a manner of resolving a "Claim" without filing a lawsuit. "Claim" means any dispute between you, Skinny Fit, or any involved third-party relating to your account, your use of the Website, your relationship with Skinny Fit, these Terms, or the Privacy Policy. This includes any and all claims that relate in any way to your use or attempted use of the products, and any act or omission by Skinny Fit or any third-party related to your use or attempted use of the products. You, Skinny Fit, or any involved third-party may pursue a Claim. Skinny Fit agrees to final and binding confidential arbitration should it have any Claims against you. Likewise, you agree to final and binding confidential arbitration should you have any Claims against Skinny Fit. By agreeing to arbitrate, you waive the right to go to court and agree instead to submit any Claims to final and binding confidential arbitration. You further agree that all claims must be arbitrated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, only individual relief is available, and that claims of more than one customer cannot be arbitrated or consolidated with those of any other customer. This arbitration provision sets forth the terms and conditions of our agreement to final and binding confidential arbitration and is governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the "FAA"), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, as amended.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (a) a representative action for public injunctive relief pursuant to California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), Unfair Completion Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.) and/or False Advertising Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 et seq.) must be arbitrated on a class basis, (b) in the event that the foregoing clause is deemed invalid or unenforceable, a representative action for public injunctive relief pursuant to California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750 et seq.), Unfair Completion Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200 et seq.) and/or False Advertising Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500 et seq.) may be brought in the state or federal courts located in Florida on a class basis, and (c) any claims other than for public injunctive relief must be arbitrated on an individual, non-class basis as otherwise set forth in this Section.</p>
                <p>b. Exceptions</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, and as an exception to final and binding confidential arbitration, you and Skinny Fit both retain the right to pursue, in small claims court, any claim that is within that court's jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual (non-class) basis, including overdue account matters within the small claims court's jurisdiction. Skinny Fit will not demand arbitration in connection with any individual claim that you properly file and pursue in a small claims court, so long as the claim is and remains pending in that court. The following claims shall not be subject to final and binding arbitration and must be adjudicated only in the state or federal courts located in San Diego, California: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim relating to the infringement or validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, copyrights, trade secrets, or patents; or (ii) an action by Skinny Fit for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief, against you for breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims that are excluded from final and binding arbitration pursuant to this subsection "b" in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration. Small claims matters may be filed in any small claims court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction over the parties. For all other matters excluded from final and binding arbitration by this subsection "b," the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Diego, California, and forever waive any challenge to said courts' jurisdiction and venue.</p>
                <p>c. Required Pre-Dispute Procedures</p>
                <p>We acknowledge and agree that before initiating any Claim against the other, we agree to first contact the other with a written description of the dispute, which shall include all relevant documents and information, and the proposed resolution. You may send the written description of any dispute you have with us by U.S. Mail to Skinny Fit, LLC, Attn: Legal Department, 750 B Street, Suite 3300, San Diego, CA 92101. Skinny Fit will contact you by letter at the billing address you provided to us or at the email address you provided to us. You agree to negotiate with Skinny Fit or its designated representative in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason the dispute is not resolved within 60 days after receipt of the written dispute, we agree to the dispute resolution provisions below. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other term of this arbitration agreement, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located in San Diego, California to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party's rights or our intellectual property rights, as stated in subsection "b" above. You hereby expressly consent to, and forever waive any challenge to, the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of said courts in such actions.</p>
                <p>d. Commencing Arbitration</p>
                <p>You and Skinny Fit agree to commence any arbitration proceeding within 1 year after the Claim arises (the 1 year period includes the required pre-dispute procedures set forth above) and that any arbitration proceeding commenced after 1 year shall be forever barred.</p>
                <p>e. Arbitration Location</p>
                <p>If the amount in controversy is $500 or less, then the arbitration may be conducted by telephone or by written submissions. Otherwise, the arbitration shall be conducted in San Diego, California unless Skinny Fit otherwise agrees to arbitrate in another forum requested by you.</p>
                <p>f. Organization, Rules and the Arbitrator</p>
                <p>We each agree that any and all Claims other than those exempted under subsection "b" above shall be submitted to final and binding confidential arbitration before a single arbitrator of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party, within the time period set forth in subsection "d" above. The arbitrator shall be selected by agreement of the parties or, if the parties cannot agree, chosen in accordance with Rules of the AAA. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA's Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. The AAA'S Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, construction, validity, applicability, or enforceability of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether any dispute is arbitrable. The arbitrator shall have the exclusive and sole authority to determine whether this arbitration agreement can be enforced against a non-signatory to this agreement and whether a non-signatory to this agreement can enforce this provision against you or Skinny Fit.</p>
                <p>g. Fees</p>
                <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's Rules.</p>
                <p>h. Governing Law and Award</p>
                <p>The arbitrator shall follow the substantive law of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Any award rendered shall include a confidential written opinion and shall be final, subject to appeal under the FAA. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>i. Enforceability</p>
                <p>This provision survives termination of your account or relationship with Skinny Fit, bankruptcy, assignment, or transfer. If the class action waiver is deemed unenforceable (i.e., unenforceability would allow arbitration to proceed as a class or representative action), then this entire arbitration provision shall be rendered null and void and shall not apply. If a portion of this arbitration provision (other than the class action waiver) is deemed unenforceable, the remaining portions of this arbitration provision shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <p>j. Miscellaneous</p>
                <p>Failure or any delay in enforcing this arbitration provision in connection with any particular Claim will not constitute a waiver of any rights to require arbitration at a later time or in connection with any other Claims except all Claims must be brought within the 1 year limitation period set forth above. This provision is the entire arbitration agreement between you and Skinny Fit and shall not be modified except in writing by Skinny Fit.</p>
