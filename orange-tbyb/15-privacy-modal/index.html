                <p><strong>Effective Date: March 5, 2024</strong></p>
                <p>This website (the "Site") is operated by Skinny Fit, LLC ("Skinny Fit," "we," "our," or "us"). Skinny Fit provides this Privacy Policy to help you understand our information collecting practices and how we use and share any information collected in connection with our Site, online services, products, and services (the "Services").

We collect both personal and non-personal information from you in several different ways on this Site:</p>
                <p><strong>Directly from You</strong> - we collect information from you when you place an order for any of Skinny Fit's products, sign up for our newsletter, or otherwise provide Skinny Fit with personal information willingly. Specifically, we collect the following categories of information:</p>
                <p>• Identification Information - information you provide when purchasing an item or signing up for our newsletter, such as your name, postal address, phone number, and email address.</p>
                <p>• Financial information - information you provide when purchasing an item, such as your credit, debit, or other payment card number, and your billing address.</p>

                <p><strong>Indirectly from You</strong> - we may collect information indirectly from you when you use or interact with the Site. This information is needed to protect the Site from fraud and to provide an efficient, meaningful, and customized experience. We collect the following categories of information:</p>
                <p>• Device Data - we may collect information about the device you use to access our Site, such as your computer or mobile device's operating system type and version, browser type, language, Internet protocol ("IP") address, Internet service provider, date/time stamp for system administration, mobile device carrier, and other personal identifiers.</p>
                <p>• Internet Activity Information - the Site server automatically recognizes the Internet URL from which you access the Site. We may also collect information about how you use and interact with the Site or an advertisement.</p>
                <p>• Commercial Information - such as your browsing and shopping tendencies, along with inferences drawn from any of the information collected.</p>
                <p>• Geolocation Data- we may collect geolocation data from time to time on the Site.</p>
                <p><strong>Cookies</strong> - Like many sites, this Site employs cookies and web beacons (also known as clear GIF technology or "action tags") to speed up your navigation of the Site, recognize you and your access privileges, and track your Site usage. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored as text files by your Internet browser on your computer's hard drive. Most Internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies from web sites or to remove cookies from your hard drive, but if you do, you will not be able to access or use portions of the Site. We have to use cookies to enable you to select products, place them in an online shopping cart, and to purchase those products. If you do this, we keep a record of your browsing activity and purchases. THE SITE'S COOKIES DO NOT AND CANNOT INFILTRATE A USER'S HARD DRIVE TO GATHER A USER'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Our cookies are not "spyware."</p>
                <p>Web beacons assist in delivering cookies and help us determine whether a web page on the Site has been viewed and, if so, how many times. For example, any electronic image on the Site, such as an ad banner, can function as a web beacon.</p>
                <p>We may use third-party advertising companies to help tailor site content to users or to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and web beacons to measure advertising effectiveness (such as the web pages visited or products purchased and in what amount). Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any personal information collected by us. As an example, Facebook collects certain information via cookies and web beacons to determine which web pages are visited or what products are purchased. Please note that any information collected by Facebook via cookies and web beacons is not linked to any customer's personal information collected by us.</p>
                <p><strong>From Other Sources</strong> - we may collect information from data aggregators or data providers to supplement information you provide to us.</p>
